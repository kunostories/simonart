Website for artist Michael A. Simon

Assignment 1: Responsive Design Project for:

Harvard Extension DGMD E-20: Understanding and Developing Multimedia

Michael A. Simon is a friend of mine living in Gwangju, South Korea. He took over my lease on a club house affectionately known as the "Art House" located in a prime location on Art Street in downtown Gwangju. Michael asked me to redo is personal/professional art website. This project is the result.

His goal is to keep the site "simple so that the art will shine". It is with that in mind that I have designed and built the site.

The main objective of the course project is to build a site with a responsive design using the Twitter Bootstrap framework and LESS.

Please view the site through different viewports to experience the full effect.
